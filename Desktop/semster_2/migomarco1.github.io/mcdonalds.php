				<h2>MCDONALD'S HAPPY MEAL TOYS</h2>
				<div class="contentText">
					<p>During my internship in Leo Burnett, the McDonald's client requested three happy meal games for sibilings, friends, or family with children aged 3-8 years in the gulf region. They did not want any use of external resources such as pens, paper, dice, etc. 
					</p>
					<p>The parameters set were limiting to the use of an A4 cardboard with perferations. They required a social game that could be played with two of more people. The invertred words are the Arabic version that will be replaced by an Arabic copywriter.
					</p>
					<p>The three games shown were the games that got approved and currently in use for the next 5 years.
